			<p> Calum Davidson was a a well-known regional planner and photographer. He described himself as a photographer with a day job, living in a very photogenic part of the globe, and who got to travel a bit to other almost as photogenic bits of the planet.</p>

			<p> A native to Caithness, he was brought up in Thurso, Shetland and Inverness, and had family ties in North Sutherland. He was a Graduate of the Glasgow School of Art and lived in the Scottish town of Cromarty from 1985 until his <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/15571729.obituary-calum-davidson-planner-devoted-to-the-economic-development-of-the-highlands/" target="_blank">death in 2017</a>. </p>

			<p> A lot of his photography is from Cromarty. On a day to day basis he enjoyed visually recording the every day life of the small Highland town, but also capturing the more unusual and quirky objects that can be seen on a walk looking out to sea, at the harbour, along the beach, or through the streets and vennels of one of Scotland's more historic little burghs.</p>

			<p> His <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ccgd/" target="_blank"> Flickr Photostream</a> is worth viewing first and chronicles what he observed and snapped from his life in Cromarty, and travels from his day job, which took him around the Highlands and Islands, as well as to the rest of Scotland, the UK, Europe and the USA.</p>

			<p> Calumâ€™s photos are regularly featured in a variety of books, magazines and newspapers, and an eclectic selection by be licensed through <a href ="https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/search/photographer?photographer=Calum%20Davidson%20-%20calum%20davidson%20dot%20com&alloweduse=availableforalluses&excludenudity=true&family=creative&license=rf&sort=best&page=1#license" target="_blank">Getty Images</a>.</p>

			<p> Some of his writing can be read on <a href="https://medium.com/@ccgdavidson" target="_blank"> Medium</a>, including a guide to photography in Cromarty.</p>
